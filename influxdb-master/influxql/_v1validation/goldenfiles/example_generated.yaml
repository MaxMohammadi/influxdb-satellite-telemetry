  This test suite demonstrates how to use the generated
  option for producing a dataset based on TOML schema.

tests:
  - query: "select sum(f0) from m0"
    result: |
      name,tags,time,sum
      m0,,0,10

generated:
  start: "1000000000000"
  end:   "5000000000000"

    name = "m0"
    tags = [
      { name = "tag0", source = [ "host1" ] },
    ]
    fields = [
      { name = "f0", count = 10, source = 1 },
    ]
