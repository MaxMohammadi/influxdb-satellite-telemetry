  This test suite verifies correctness of queries containing
  fields in the WHERE condition. In most cases, the field
  in the SELECT projection is different, to test joins across
  fields.

tests:
  - name: "no_aggregate"
    query: "select f1 from m0 where f0 > 1 AND time >= 30000000000 AND time <= 50000000000"
    result: |
      name,tags,time,f1
      m0,,50000000000,30

  - name: "aggregate"

      This test verifies that an aggregate

    query: "SELECT sum(f1) FROM m0 WHERE f0 >= 1"
    result: |
      name,tags,time,sum
      m0,,0,50
